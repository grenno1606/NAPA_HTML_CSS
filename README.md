## 📝 Overview

The goal is to convert the entire Figma design into a responsive web page using only HTML5 and CSS3, following BEM naming conventions. No SCSS, JavaScript, or UI libraries are used.

---

## 🚀 Requirements

1. **Use HTML5 Semantic Tags:**  
   Use tags such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.

2. **Responsive Design:**  
   The layout must adapt to different screen sizes.

3. **BEM Class Naming:**

   - Follow [BEM](http://getbem.com/naming/) (Block Element Modifier) methodology.
   - Do **not** combine selectors (e.g., `.a.b`).
   - Do **not** nest selectors (flat CSS only, as SCSS is not used).

4. **Assets:**

   - Export assets from Figma or use placeholders if needed.

5. **No JavaScript:**
   - Only HTML and CSS are allowed.
